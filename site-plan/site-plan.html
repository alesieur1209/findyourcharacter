			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This site will act as a large database and filter for cosplayers looking for characters.
                A user will be able to check tags based on what they look like (female, blonde, blue eyes, etc.) and then the filter 
                will return a list of characters who resemble the user. The user can then use these results to decide which character they
                want to cosplay as next. 
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Cosplayers of all ages, or people simply looking for costume inspiration. Most cosplayers are typically teens and young adults,
                but anyone can use this site. 
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Characters will be programmed as a series of objects which can be filtered through and returned. The filter will have tags that
				can be selected, and then the submit button will call results based on these tags. The search bar will also be functional so users can 
				search up characters by name. Results will display a thumbnail image of a character which can be clicked on to show further details. 
				Lastly, users will be able to sign up with an email to create an account for the website. If I have enough time then I'll
				add benefits to being logged in such as being able to save search presets and certain favorite characters to your profile.

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Page2</a>
				<a href="#">Page3</a>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Filter Page</h3>
			<p>The filter page will contain a series of tags each in their own category.
				For example: The category of "Hair Color" will have tags including but not limited to "blonde, brown, black, etc."
				Categories will include but are not limited to "Hair Color, Hair Length, Eye color, Skin Color, Height, Age, etc."
				No images will be present on the filter page. At the bottom will be a "Submit" button to run the data through the system. 
			</p>
			<h3>Results Page</h3>
			<p>The results page will be a series of character images with the character's name listed below each image. The number of images
				will vary based on what tags the user checked on the filter page. I won't include every character's image here because there's 
				going to eventually be a lot. 
			</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>

			<h3>Filter Page</h3>
			<p>
				The filter will be a series of categories, each with multiple boxes to check from.
