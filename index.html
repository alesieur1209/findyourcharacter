            <h2>Welcome!</h2>

           <p>Welcome to "Find Your Character"! This site functions as a searchable database for characters and is meant to help
            cosplayers find their next project.</p>

          <p>Lots of people are into cosplaying, or simply enjoy dressing up as their favorite characters for events like halloween. 
            With so many existing characters in the world to choose from, some might find it difficult to know where to start.
            Oftentimes people are on a budget and can't afford things such as colorful wigs or special eye contacts. 
            Because of this some people might start by looking for characters they already resemble in real life. That's where
            the "Find Your Character" filter tool can help! Simply select which tags you want to filter by, such as "female", "blonde hair", 
            or "blue eyes" and let the site return an array of characters for you!
          </p>

          <p>Right now we are only a basic prototype, but we hope to eventually add lots of functions in the future! Users will eventually
            be able to upload their own characters to the database, log in to an account to save their presets, and even upload comments onto
            their favorite characters sharing advice or pictures of their cosplay! In the meantime, feel free to test out the filter tool and
            search bar.
          </p>
